      personalInfo: {},
      skills: [],
      portfolio: [],
      setStep: (step) => set({ currentStep: step }),
      updatePersonalInfo: (data) => set({ personalInfo: data }),
      // ... other actions
    }),
    {
      name: 'critvue-application', // localStorage key
      partialize: (state) => ({
        // Only persist form data, not UI state
        personalInfo: state.personalInfo,
        skills: state.skills,
        portfolio: state.portfolio,
      }),
    }
  )
)
```

  const percentage = (currentStep / totalSteps) * 100

  return (
    <div className="progress-container">
      <div className="progress-labels">
        {stepLabels?.map((label, i) => (
          <span
            key={i}
            className={i + 1 === currentStep ? 'active' : i + 1 < currentStep ? 'complete' : ''}
          >
            {i + 1}. {label}
          </span>
        ))}
      </div>
      <motion.div
        className="progress-bar"
        initial={false}
        animate={{ width: `${percentage}%` }}

        Step {currentStep} of {totalSteps} • {Math.round(percentage)}% complete
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

### Auto-Save Implementation

**Strategy: Debounced localStorage + API backup**

```typescript
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useDebounce } from '@/hooks/useDebounce'
import { useApplicationStore } from '@/store/application'

const AutoSave = () => {
  const formData = useApplicationStore((state) => state)
  const debouncedFormData = useDebounce(formData, 2000) // 2 second delay

  useEffect(() => {
    // Save to localStorage (instant)
    localStorage.setItem('application-draft', JSON.stringify(formData))

    // Save to API (debounced)
    if (debouncedFormData) {
      saveDraftToAPI(debouncedFormData)
    }
  }, [debouncedFormData])

  return (
    <div className="auto-save-indicator">
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isSaving ? (
          <motion.span
            initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
          >
            Saving...
          </motion.span>
        ) : (
          <motion.span
            initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
          >
            ✓ Saved
          </motion.span>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Resume Draft Flow:**
```typescript
// On app load, check for saved draft
useEffect(() => {
  const draft = localStorage.getItem('application-draft')
  if (draft) {
    const shouldResume = window.confirm(
      'We found a saved draft. Would you like to continue where you left off?'
    )
    if (shouldResume) {
      useApplicationStore.setState(JSON.parse(draft))
    } else {
      localStorage.removeItem('application-draft')
    }
  }
}, [])
```

---

### File Upload Solution

**Recommended: Uppy with Direct S3 Upload**

```typescript
import Uppy from '@uppy/core'
import Dashboard from '@uppy/dashboard'
import AwsS3 from '@uppy/aws-s3'
import ImageEditor from '@uppy/image-editor'

const uppy = new Uppy({
  restrictions: {
    maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
    maxNumberOfFiles: 5,
    allowedFileTypes: ['image/*', '.pdf', '.doc', '.docx']
  },
  autoProceed: false
})
  .use(Dashboard, {
    inline: true,
    target: '#upload-container',
    proudlyDisplayPoweredByUppy: false,
    showProgressDetails: true,
    height: 400,
    note: 'Upload 3-5 work samples (PDF, DOC, or images)'
  })
  .use(ImageEditor, {
    target: Dashboard,
    quality: 0.8
  })
  .use(AwsS3, {
    companionUrl: '/api/upload', // Your backend endpoint for pre-signed URLs
  })

uppy.on('upload-success', (file, response) => {
  const url = response.uploadURL
  // Add to Zustand store
  useApplicationStore.getState().addPortfolioItem({
    id: file.id,
    url,
    name: file.name,
    type: file.type,
    size: file.size
  })
})
```

## 4. Mobile-Specific Considerations

### Native Mobile Patterns to Adopt

#### 1. Bottom Sheet Pattern
**When to Use:**
- Quick actions (add reference, select skill)
- Upload options (camera, files, drive)
- Filters or selections
- Confirmation dialogs

**Implementation (shadcn/ui Sheet):**
```typescript
import { Sheet, SheetContent, SheetTrigger } from '@/components/ui/sheet'

<Sheet>
  <SheetTrigger>Upload Portfolio</SheetTrigger>
  <SheetContent side="bottom" className="h-[90vh]">
    <h3>Choose Upload Method</h3>
    <button>📷 Take Photo</button>
    <button>📁 Choose from Files</button>
    <button>☁️ Import from Google Drive</button>
  </SheetContent>
</Sheet>
```

**Best Practices:**
- Maximum 90vh height
- Dismissible via swipe down
- Backdrop blur/dim
- Keep content focused and concise

#### 2. Swipe Gestures
**Tinder-Style Card Navigation:**
```typescript
import { motion, useMotionValue, useTransform } from 'framer-motion'

const SwipeCard = ({ onSwipeLeft, onSwipeRight, children }) => {
  const x = useMotionValue(0)
  const rotate = useTransform(x, [-200, 200], [-25, 25])
  const opacity = useTransform(x, [-200, -100, 0, 100, 200], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0])

  const handleDragEnd = (event, info) => {
    if (info.offset.x > 100) {
      onSwipeRight()
    } else if (info.offset.x < -100) {
      onSwipeLeft()
    }
  }

  return (
    <motion.div
      drag="x"
      dragConstraints={{ left: 0, right: 0 }}
      style={{ x, rotate, opacity }}
      onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  )
}

// Usage: Swipe right to go next, left to go back
<SwipeCard
  onSwipeRight={goToNextStep}
  onSwipeLeft={goToPreviousStep}
>
  <StepContent />
</SwipeCard>
```

**Use Cases:**
- Navigate between form steps
- Dismiss completed sections
- Quick yes/no selections

#### 3. Floating Action Button (FAB)
**Primary CTA Always Accessible:**
```typescript
const FloatingActionButton = ({ onClick, label, disabled }) => {
  return (
    <motion.button
      className="fixed bottom-6 right-6 rounded-full bg-primary text-white px-6 py-4 shadow-lg z-50"
      whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
      whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
      initial={{ y: 100 }}
      animate={{ y: 0 }}
      transition={{ type: 'spring', stiffness: 260, damping: 20 }}
    >
      {label}
    </motion.button>
  )
}

// Usage
<FloatingActionButton
  onClick={handleSubmitStep}
  label="Continue"
  disabled={!isStepValid}
/>
```

#### 4. Native Camera Integration
**HTML5 File Input (Best for Web):**
```html
<!-- Image capture -->
<input
  type="file"
  accept="image/*"
  capture="camera"
  onChange={handlePhotoCapture}
/>

<!-- Any file + camera option -->
<input
  type="file"
  accept="image/*,application/pdf,.doc,.docx"
  onChange={handleFileUpload}
/>
```

**Progressive Enhancement:**
- On mobile: Triggers native camera picker
- On desktop: Opens file browser
- iOS 6+ and Android 3.0+ support
- Use `getUserMedia` only for custom camera UI (rare)

#### 5. Haptic Feedback
**Subtle Physical Feedback:**
```typescript
// Requires HTTPS or localhost
const vibrate = (pattern: number | number[]) => {
  if ('vibrate' in navigator) {
    navigator.vibrate(pattern)
  }
}

// Usage examples:
vibrate(50) // Short tap feedback
vibrate([50, 100, 50]) // Success pattern
vibrate(200) // Error feedback

// In form context:
const handleSubmit = () => {
  if (isValid) {
    vibrate(50) // Subtle success tap
    goToNextStep()
  } else {
    vibrate([100, 50, 100]) // Error shake
    showValidationErrors()
  }
}
```

#### 6. Pull-to-Refresh (Optional)
**For Draft Recovery:**
```typescript
import { usePullToRefresh } from '@/hooks/usePullToRefresh'

const ApplicationForm = () => {
  usePullToRefresh({
    onRefresh: async () => {
      await loadDraftFromAPI()
    },
    threshold: 100
  })

  return <form>...</form>
}
```

### Gesture Interactions

#### Swipe Patterns
| Gesture | Action | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Swipe Right | Go back/previous | Navigation between steps |
| Swipe Left | Go next (if valid) | Navigation between steps |
| Swipe Up | Expand detail | View full portfolio item |
| Swipe Down | Dismiss/close | Close modals, bottom sheets |
| Long Press | Show options | Edit/delete credential |
| Pinch | Zoom | Image preview |

**Implementation Consideration:**
- Don't override native browser gestures (swipe to go back)
- Provide visual cues (arrows, shadows) for swipeable elements
- Always provide alternative button navigation
- Test on iOS and Android separately (different gesture engines)

---

### Keyboard Optimization

#### HTML5 Input Types
```html
<!-- Email: Shows @ and .com shortcuts -->
<input type="email" name="email" autocomplete="email" />

<!-- Phone: Shows numeric keypad -->
<input type="tel" name="phone" autocomplete="tel" />

<!-- URL: Shows .com and / shortcuts -->
<input type="url" name="linkedin" />

<!-- Number: Shows numeric keyboard (use with caution) -->
<input type="number" name="years" min="0" max="50" />

<!-- Search: Shows search button on keyboard -->
<input type="search" name="skills" />

<!-- Date: Shows native date picker -->
<input type="date" name="graduation-year" />
```

#### The `inputmode` Attribute (Fine-Tuned Control)
```html
<!-- Numeric keyboard without spinner buttons -->
<input type="text" inputmode="numeric" name="phone" />

<!-- Decimal keyboard -->
<input type="text" inputmode="decimal" name="gpa" />

<!-- Email keyboard -->
<input type="text" inputmode="email" name="backup-email" />

<!-- URL keyboard -->
<input type="text" inputmode="url" name="portfolio-url" />

<!-- Search keyboard -->
<input type="text" inputmode="search" name="skill-search" />
```

**When to Use:**
- Use `inputmode="numeric"` for phone numbers (avoids type="number" issues)
- Use `type="email"` for email addresses
- Use `type="url"` for website URLs
- Use `type="tel"` for phone numbers with formatting

#### Autocomplete Attributes
```html
<!-- Enables browser autofill -->
<input type="text" name="full-name" autocomplete="name" />
<input type="email" name="email" autocomplete="email" />
<input type="tel" name="phone" autocomplete="tel" />
<input type="text" name="company" autocomplete="organization" />
<input type="text" name="job-title" autocomplete="organization-title" />
<input type="text" name="city" autocomplete="address-level2" />
<input type="text" name="country" autocomplete="country-name" />
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces typing by 50%+
- Improves accuracy
- Faster completion rates
- Better mobile UX

---

### Offline Support (Progressive Web App)

**Service Worker for Draft Caching:**
```typescript
// service-worker.ts
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('/api/draft')) {
    event.respondWith(
      fetch(event.request)
        .catch(() => {
          // If offline, return cached draft
          return caches.match(event.request)
        })
    )
  }
})

// In application:
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
}
```

**Offline Indicator:**
```typescript
import { useNetworkStatus } from '@/hooks/useNetworkStatus'

const OfflineIndicator = () => {
  const isOnline = useNetworkStatus()

  if (isOnline) return null

  return (
    <div className="offline-banner">
      ⚠️ You're offline. Your progress is saved locally and will sync when you're back online.
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

## 5. Progress & Gamification

### Progress Indicators

#### Visual Progress Bar
**Recommended Pattern: Hybrid (Bar + Steps)**
```
[●━━━○━━━○━━━○━━━○━━━○━━━○━━━○]
 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

Step 2 of 8: Professional Background
25% complete • ~6 minutes remaining
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const ProgressIndicator = ({ currentStep, totalSteps, stepLabels, estimatedTimeRemaining }) => {
  const percentage = (currentStep / totalSteps) * 100

  return (
    <div className="progress-container">
      {/* Visual bar with gradient */}
      <div className="progress-track">
        <motion.div
          className="progress-fill"
          initial={{ width: 0 }}
          animate={{ width: `${percentage}%` }}
          style={{
            background: `linear-gradient(90deg,
              hsl(${percentage * 1.2}, 70%, 50%),
              hsl(${percentage * 1.2 + 20}, 70%, 60%)
            )`
          }}
        />
      </div>

      {/* Step indicators */}
      <div className="step-indicators">
        {Array.from({ length: totalSteps }).map((_, i) => (
          <div
            key={i}
            className={cn(
              'step-dot',
              i + 1 === currentStep && 'active',
              i + 1 < currentStep && 'complete'
            )}
          >
            {i + 1 < currentStep ? '✓' : i + 1}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      {/* Text information */}
      <div className="progress-text">
        <span className="step-label">
          Step {currentStep} of {totalSteps}: {stepLabels[currentStep - 1]}
        </span>
        <span className="meta">
          {Math.round(percentage)}% complete • ~{estimatedTimeRemaining} min remaining
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Color Transitions:**
- 0-33%: Red → Orange (starting out)
- 34-66%: Orange → Yellow (making progress)
- 67-100%: Yellow → Green (almost done!)

---

### Estimated Time Remaining

**Algorithm:**
```typescript
const calculateTimeRemaining = (
  currentStep: number,
  totalSteps: number,
  stepTimes: number[], // Average time per step in seconds
  startTime: number
) => {
  const elapsedTime = Date.now() - startTime
  const completedSteps = currentStep - 1
  const avgTimePerStep = completedSteps > 0
    ? elapsedTime / completedSteps
    : stepTimes[currentStep - 1]

  const remainingSteps = totalSteps - currentStep
  const estimatedRemaining = remainingSteps * avgTimePerStep

  return Math.ceil(estimatedRemaining / 60000) // Convert to minutes
}

// Usage
const estimatedMinutes = calculateTimeRemaining(
  currentStep,
  totalSteps,
  [30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 90, 60, 180], // Estimated seconds per step
  applicationStartTime
)
```

---

### Celebration Moments

#### Milestone Animations

**50% Complete:**
```typescript
import confetti from 'canvas-confetti'

const celebrate50Percent = () => {
  confetti({
    particleCount: 50,
    spread: 60,
    origin: { y: 0.6 },
    colors: ['#FFA500', '#FFD700']
  })

  toast({
    title: "Halfway there! 🎉",
    description: "You're doing great! Just 4 more steps to go.",
    variant: "success"
  })
}

// Trigger when currentStep === totalSteps / 2
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentStep === Math.ceil(totalSteps / 2) && !hasCelebrated50) {
    celebrate50Percent()
    setHasCelebrated50(true)
  }
}, [currentStep])
```

**100% Complete:**
```typescript
const celebrateCompletion = () => {
  // Large confetti burst
  confetti({
    particleCount: 200,
    spread: 120,
    origin: { y: 0.5 },
    colors: ['#00C853', '#64DD17', '#76FF03'],
    ticks: 200
  })

  // Haptic feedback (mobile)
  navigator.vibrate?.([100, 50, 100, 50, 100])

  // Success sound (optional)
  const audio = new Audio('/sounds/success.mp3')
  audio.play().catch(() => {}) // Ignore if blocked

  // Redirect after celebration
  setTimeout(() => {
    router.push('/application-submitted')
  }, 2000)
}
```

#### Micro-Celebrations
**After Each Step:**
```typescript
const celebrateStepCompletion = () => {
  // Subtle checkmark animation
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ scale: 0, rotate: -180 }}
      animate={{ scale: 1, rotate: 0 }}
      transition={{ type: 'spring', duration: 0.6 }}
      className="step-complete-icon"
    >
      ✓
    </motion.div>
  )
}

// Encouraging toast
toast({
  title: "Step complete!",
  description: stepCompletionMessages[currentStep],
  variant: "success"
})
```

**Encouraging Messages (Dynamic):**
```typescript
const stepCompletionMessages = [
  "Great start! Let's keep going.",
  "Looking good! You're making progress.",
  "Excellent! Halfway through this section.",
  "Awesome work! Almost there.",
  "Fantastic! You're on fire! 🔥",
  "Brilliant! Just a few more steps.",
  "Outstanding! You're nearly done.",
  "Amazing! One last step to go! 💪"
]
```

---

### Save & Resume Pattern

**Persistent Draft Indicator:**
```typescript
const DraftIndicator = () => {
  const lastSaved = useApplicationStore(state => state.lastSaved)
  const isDirty = useApplicationStore(state => state.isDirty)

  return (
    <div className="draft-indicator">
      <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
        {isDirty ? (
          <motion.span
            key="saving"
            initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -10 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0, y: 10 }}
          >
            💾 Saving...
          </motion.span>
        ) : (
          <motion.span
            key="saved"
            initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -10 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0, y: 10 }}
          >
            ✓ Saved {formatDistanceToNow(lastSaved, { addSuffix: true })}
          </motion.span>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Resume Draft Dialog:**
```typescript
const ResumeDraftDialog = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  const draft = useApplicationStore(state => state.draft)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (draft && draft.currentStep > 1) {
      setOpen(true)
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Welcome back!</DialogTitle>
          <DialogDescription>
            We found your saved application from{' '}
            {formatDistanceToNow(draft.lastModified, { addSuffix: true })}.
            You were on step {draft.currentStep} of 8.
          </DialogDescription>
        </DialogHeader>
        <DialogFooter>
          <Button variant="outline" onClick={startFresh}>
            Start Fresh
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={resumeDraft}>
            Resume Application
          </Button>
        </DialogFooter>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  )
}
```

## 6. Accessibility & Inclusive Design

### WCAG 2.2 Compliance Checklist

#### Touch Targets (Mobile Critical)
**Minimum Size: 44×44px (WCAG 2.1)**
**Recommended: 48×48px or larger**

```css
/* All interactive elements */
.btn, .input, .checkbox, .radio, .link {
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
  padding: 12px 16px;
}

/* Touch target spacing */
.btn + .btn {
  margin-top: 12px; /* Prevent accidental taps */
}
```

**Exception:** Links in paragraphs can be smaller (but increase line-height for easier tapping)

---

#### Keyboard Navigation
**All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible:**

```typescript
// Custom component example
const SkillChip = ({ skill, onRemove }) => {
  return (
    <div
      role="button"
      tabIndex={0}
      onKeyDown={(e) => {
        if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
          onRemove(skill)
        }
      }}
      onClick={() => onRemove(skill)}
      aria-label={`Remove ${skill}`}
    >
      {skill}
      <span aria-hidden="true">×</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Tab Order:**
1. Main navigation
2. Progress indicator (focusable but not interactive)
3. Form fields (in logical order)
4. Primary CTA
5. Secondary actions (back, save draft)

**Skip Links:**
```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

---

#### Screen Reader Optimization

**Form Labels (Required):**
```html
<!-- ✅ Good -->
<label for="full-name">Full Name</label>
<input id="full-name" type="text" required aria-required="true" />

<!-- ❌ Bad -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Full Name" />
```

**Error Messages:**
```html
<label for="email">Email Address</label>
<input
  id="email"
  type="email"
  aria-describedby="email-error"
  aria-invalid={hasError}
/>
{hasError && (
  <div id="email-error" role="alert">
    Please enter a valid email address
  </div>
)}
```

**Progress Announcement:**
```typescript
const ProgressAnnouncer = ({ currentStep, totalSteps }) => {
  return (
    <div
      role="status"
      aria-live="polite"
      aria-atomic="true"
      className="sr-only"
    >
      Step {currentStep} of {totalSteps} completed
    </div>
  )
}
```

**File Upload Accessibility:**
```html
<label for="portfolio-upload">
  Upload Portfolio Samples
  <span className="sr-only">
    Accepted formats: PDF, DOC, DOCX, or images up to 10MB each
  </span>
</label>
<input
  id="portfolio-upload"
  type="file"
  multiple
  accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,image/*"
  aria-describedby="upload-instructions"
/>
<div id="upload-instructions">
  You can upload 3-5 files. Drag and drop or click to select.
</div>
```

---

#### Color Contrast
**WCAG AA Standard: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text**

```css
/* Good contrast examples */
.text-primary {
  color: #1a1a1a; /* Dark gray on white: 16:1 */
}

.btn-primary {
  background: #0066cc; /* Blue */
  color: #ffffff; /* White text: 4.6:1 ✓ */
}

.error-text {
  color: #c41e3a; /* Red with enough contrast: 5.2:1 ✓ */
}
```

**Color-Blind Friendly:**
- Don't rely on color alone (use icons + text)
- Red/green errors: Add ✗ and ✓ symbols
- Progress: Use both color and percentage

```html
<!-- ✅ Good: Icon + color + text -->
<div className="error">
  <span aria-hidden="true">⚠️</span>
  <span className="error-text">Email is required</span>
</div>

<!-- ❌ Bad: Color only -->
<div className="text-red-500">Email is required</div>
```

---

#### Reduced Motion Support
**Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:**

```css
/* Default: Animations enabled */
.step-transition {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out, opacity 0.3s ease-out;
}

/* Reduced motion: Instant or minimal animation */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .step-transition {
    transition: opacity 0.1s ease-out;
    transform: none !important;
  }

  .confetti-animation {
    display: none; /* Skip confetti for motion-sensitive users */
  }
}
```

**Framer Motion Implementation:**
```typescript
const shouldReduceMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: shouldReduceMotion ? 0 : 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: shouldReduceMotion ? 0.1 : 0.3 }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

---

#### High Contrast Mode (Windows)
```css
/* Support Windows High Contrast Mode */
@media (prefers-contrast: high) {
  .btn-primary {
    border: 2px solid currentColor;
  }

  .input {
    border: 2px solid currentColor;
  }

  .progress-bar {
    outline: 2px solid currentColor;
  }
}
```

---

#### Form Validation Accessibility
**Inline Validation Pattern:**
```typescript
const EmailInput = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
  const [error, setError] = useState('')
  const [touched, setTouched] = useState(false)

  const validate = (value: string) => {
    if (!value) return 'Email is required'
    if (!/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(value)) return 'Invalid email format'
    return ''
  }

  const handleBlur = () => {
    setTouched(true)
    setError(validate(email))
  }

  const hasError = touched && error

  return (
    <div className="form-field">
      <label htmlFor="email">
        Email Address
        <span aria-label="required">*</span>
      </label>
      <input
        id="email"
        type="email"
        value={email}
        onChange={(e) => {
          setEmail(e.target.value)
          if (touched) setError(validate(e.target.value))
        }}
        onBlur={handleBlur}
        aria-invalid={hasError}
        aria-describedby={hasError ? 'email-error' : undefined}
        aria-required="true"
      />
      {hasError && (
        <div id="email-error" role="alert" className="error-message">
          <span aria-hidden="true">⚠️</span>
          {error}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Required Field Indicators:**
```html
<!-- ✅ Accessible required indicator -->
<label for="name">
  Full Name
  <abbr title="required" aria-label="required">*</abbr>
</label>

<!-- Or with sr-only text -->
<label for="name">
  Full Name
  <span className="sr-only">required</span>
  <span aria-hidden="true">*</span>
</label>
```

## 7. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Form Design Anti-Patterns

#### 1. Premature Validation
**❌ BAD: Error shown while typing**
```typescript
// Don't do this
<input
  onChange={(e) => {
    setValue(e.target.value)
    validateImmediately(e.target.value) // Annoying!
  }}
/>
```

**✅ GOOD: Validate after blur**
```typescript
<input
  value={value}
  onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
  onBlur={() => validate(value)} // Better UX
/>
```

**Why:** Showing errors while users are still typing is frustrating and distracting. Wait until they've finished (blur event) or attempted to submit.

---

#### 2. Cryptic Error Messages
**❌ BAD:**
- "Field is empty"
- "Invalid input"
- "Error: 422"

**✅ GOOD:**
- "Please enter your full name"
- "Email must include @ and a domain (e.g., user@example.com)"
- "File size must be less than 10MB. Your file is 12.5MB."

**Why:** Users need to understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

---

#### 3. No Progress Saving
**❌ BAD:** Losing all data on accidental back button, browser crash, or form error

**✅ GOOD:** Auto-save to localStorage every 2-3 seconds, show "Saved" indicator

**Why:** Long forms (8 steps) are at high risk of abandonment. One study found that Expedia lost $12M from one extra data field causing errors.

---

#### 4. Overly Complex Password Requirements
**❌ BAD:** "Password must be 12+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, special character, blood type, and your mother's maiden name"

**✅ GOOD:** "Password must be at least 8 characters" + show strength meter

**Why:** Complex requirements frustrate users and don't significantly improve security. Focus on length over complexity.

---

#### 5. Dropdown Overkill
**❌ BAD:** Dropdown for 3-5 options (e.g., gender, professional level)

**✅ GOOD:** Radio buttons or segmented control

**Why:** Dropdowns require 3 clicks (open, select, close) vs 1 click for radio buttons. Especially bad on mobile.

---

#### 6. Unlabeled Form Fields (Placeholder-Only)
**❌ BAD:**
```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Full Name" />
```

**✅ GOOD:**
```html
<label for="name">Full Name</label>
<input id="name" type="text" placeholder="e.g., Jane Smith" />
```

**Why:**
- Placeholders disappear when typing (users forget what field is for)
- Poor accessibility (screen readers may not announce placeholders)
- Low contrast (often gray text)

---

#### 7. Asking for Information You Don't Need
**❌ BAD:** Asking for birthday, gender, SSN, fax number when irrelevant

**✅ GOOD:** Only ask for essential information + clearly optional fields

**Why:** Every additional field reduces completion rate by ~10% (Baymard Institute). Respect user's time and privacy.

---

#### 8. Breaking "Back" Button Behavior
**❌ BAD:** Multi-step form that breaks browser back button or starts over

**✅ GOOD:** Back button returns to previous step, preserving data

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Use Next.js router or React Router with state
const router = useRouter()

const goBack = () => {
  router.back() // Or setCurrentStep(currentStep - 1)
}

// Update URL on step change
useEffect(() => {
  router.push(`/apply?step=${currentStep}`, undefined, { shallow: true })
}, [currentStep])
```

**Why:** Users expect back button to work. Breaking it creates frustration and confusion.

---

### Mobile-Specific Anti-Patterns

#### 9. Poor Mobile Responsiveness
**❌ BAD:**
- Desktop-only layouts that don't adapt
- Horizontal scrolling required
- Text too small to read (< 16px)
- Multi-column forms on mobile

**✅ GOOD:**
- Single-column layout
- Minimum 16px font size (prevents zoom on iOS)
- Full-width inputs
- Responsive breakpoints

---

#### 10. Wrong Input Types
**❌ BAD:**
```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Phone Number" />
<input type="text" placeholder="Email" />
```

**✅ GOOD:**
```html
<input type="tel" placeholder="Phone Number" autocomplete="tel" />
<input type="email" placeholder="Email" autocomplete="email" />
```

**Why:** Shows appropriate keyboard on mobile. Massive UX improvement with zero effort.

---

#### 11. Tiny Touch Targets
**❌ BAD:** 32×32px buttons, links without padding, checkboxes that are 12×12px

**✅ GOOD:** Minimum 44×44px (WCAG), 48×48px recommended

**Why:** Accidental taps, frustration, accessibility issues. 91% of screen reader users use mobile devices.

---

#### 12. Disabled Submit Button (Without Feedback)
**❌ BAD:** Grayed-out submit button with no explanation

**✅ GOOD:** Show why button is disabled (e.g., "Complete all required fields to continue")

**Implementation:**
```typescript
<button disabled={!isValid}>
  Continue
</button>
{!isValid && (
  <p className="text-sm text-muted">
    {getValidationMessage()} // "Please select at least 3 skills"
  </p>
)}
```

**Why:** Users don't understand why they can't proceed. Provide guidance.

---

#### 13. Auto-Advance Without Warning
**❌ BAD:** Auto-advancing to next step immediately after selection

**✅ GOOD:** Let users review their answer, then click "Continue"

**Exception:** Simple yes/no questions or obvious progressions can auto-advance with animation delay

---

#### 14. Complex CAPTCHAs
**❌ BAD:** "Select all squares with traffic lights" (especially on mobile)

**✅ GOOD:** Invisible reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha (only shows if suspicious)

**Why:** CAPTCHAs are frustrating on mobile (small images, fat fingers). Use risk-based challenge only.

---

#### 15. Required Fields Not Marked
**❌ BAD:** No indication which fields are required

**✅ GOOD:** Mark required fields with * or "required" label + note at top

```html
<p className="form-note">Fields marked with * are required</p>
<label for="name">
  Full Name <span aria-label="required">*</span>
</label>
```

**Why:** Users waste time filling optional fields or skip required ones.

---

#### 16. No File Upload Preview
**❌ BAD:** File uploads with no preview, confirmation, or ability to remove

**✅ GOOD:** Show thumbnail, filename, size, progress, and delete option

**Why:** Users need confidence that correct file was uploaded. Especially important for images.

---

#### 17. Ignoring Form State on Errors
**❌ BAD:** Clearing entire form on validation error or page reload

**✅ GOOD:** Preserve all entered data, scroll to first error, highlight issues

**Why:** Forcing users to re-enter everything is the fastest way to lose them.

---

#### 18. Hidden or Unclear Progress Indicator
**❌ BAD:** No indication of how many steps remain or current position

**✅ GOOD:** Always-visible progress bar with "Step X of Y" and percentage

**Why:** Users need to know investment required. Uncertainty increases abandonment.

---

#### 19. No Mobile Testing
**❌ BAD:** "Works on my laptop" mentality

**✅ GOOD:** Test on real devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Android) + various screen sizes

**Critical Tests:**
- iOS Safari (often most restrictive)
- Android Chrome
- Different screen sizes (320px - 428px width common)
- Landscape orientation
- Slow network (3G throttling)
- Different OS keyboards

---

#### 20. Skipping Accessibility
**❌ BAD:** "We'll add accessibility later"

**✅ GOOD:** Build accessible from start (use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard nav)

**Why:**
- Harder to retrofit later
- Legal requirements (ADA, WCAG)
- 15% of global population has some disability
- Improves UX for everyone

---
