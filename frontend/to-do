  1. Excessive Client Components - 45 of 52 page.tsx files use "use client"
    - Many could be Server Components for better performance
  2. Duplicate Configuration Objects - Color schemes, icon configs repeated across:
    - creator-dashboard.tsx, HeroActionBlock.tsx, AnimatedStats.tsx
    - Fix: Centralize in lib/constants/
  3. Only 2 Custom Hooks - Heavy useState reliance (199 components)
    - Fix: Extract common patterns (form handling, API errors, modal state)
  4. 89 console.log statements still in production code
  5. Magic Numbers - Hardcoded values like 86400 (24 hours), array indices
    - Fix: Extract to named constants
  6. Limited Performance Optimization - Only 110 useCallback/useMemo instances
    - Heavy Framer Motion without memo optimization
